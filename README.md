Title: Todo List App with Local Storage

Description:
This project is a todo list web application built using the following technologies:

> HTML
> CSS
> JavaScript
The app's main functionality is implemented using JavaScript, with event listeners and functions that interact with the DOM and local storage to manage tasks. The app also uses Bootstrap for styling and fontawesome for icons.

Key points:

> The todo list app allows users to create, update, and delete tasks in a list.
> The app leverages the local storage feature of web browsers using JavaScript to store data, so that the list of tasks is not deleted after the site is refreshed or closed.
> The app features a minimalist and responsive design, with easy-to-use buttons for adding new tasks, marking tasks as completed, editing tasks, and deleting tasks.


Overall, this project serves as a great example of how to build a simple web application using popular web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also demonstrates how to leverage local storage to create a more robust user experience for web applications.
