Todo List App with Local Storage.

Description:
This is a simple todo list app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to create, update, and delete tasks in a list. In addition, the app leverages the local storage feature of web browsers using JavaScript to store data, so that the list of tasks is not deleted after the site is refreshed or closed.

The app features a minimalist and responsive design, with easy-to-use buttons for adding new tasks, marking tasks as completed, editing tasks, and deleting tasks. Users can also filter tasks by their status (i.e., all tasks, active tasks, or completed tasks) to help them focus on what's important.

The app's main functionality is implemented using JavaScript, with event listeners and functions that interact with the DOM and local storage to manage tasks. The app also uses Bootstrap for styling and fontawesome for icons.

Overall, this project serves as a great introduction to building web applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and demonstrates how to leverage local storage to create a more robust user experience.
